# AI-Powered LDPC Code Rate Adaptation for Quantum Cryptography

A machine learning model to select optimal LDPC code parameters {R, s, p} for efficient error correction in a quantum key distribution (QKD) system.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective is to develop an AI-driven solution that dynamically adapts LDPC code parameters based on real-time quantum channel characteristics. This aims to maximize the final secret key length by ensuring robust and efficient error correction.

## Problem Statement

In QKD systems, the error rate in the sifted key is non-stationary due to physical fluctuations. This project tackles the challenge of selecting the most suitable LDPC code rate (`R`), number of shortened nodes (`s`), and punctured nodes (`p`) to optimize the post-processing throughput without prior knowledge of the true error rate for a given frame.

## Our Approach: Hybrid Predict-and-Search Model

We are implementing a two-stage hybrid model:

1.  **ML-based Prediction:** A `LightGBM` model trained on historical system data provides a fast, high-quality initial prediction for the optimal `{R, s, p}` parameters.
2.  **Simulator-based Local Search:** Using the initial prediction as a starting point, a local search algorithm intelligently queries the provided simulator with nearby parameter variations. The combination that yields the maximum secret key length is chosen as the final answer for the frame.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Core Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
